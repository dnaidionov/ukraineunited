define('ABOUT_TEXT_BLOCK','<div style="max-width: 624px;" class="text">Media in Ukraine and especially in Russia is often purposefully inflammatory and divisive. Public does not trust it, yet readily consumes the programming where people with opposing political opinion get demonized and stigmatized. In-depth analysis in English is rare and often incomplete. Overall, as the conflict is escalating and the emotions are running high, people are rapidly losing the ability to listen to each other.</div><br><div style="max-width: 624px;" class="text">Ukraine United has no precedent in the mainstream media, as it shows contemporary Ukraine from a unique perspective. It consists of interviews of people from every region of Ukraine, and from different social, religious, and political statuses. They speak about the Maidan revolution, the annexation of Crimea, the war in the Eastern Ukraine, and the possible resolution of this crisis.</div><br><div style="max-width: 624px;" class="text">Ukraine United is a platform where people can read each other\'s opinion and realize that they can disagree but still find common ground. We want everyone to use their own judgement about the situation in Ukraine instead of consuming unprofessional reporting and blunt propaganda</div>');
